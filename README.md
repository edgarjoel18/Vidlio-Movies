# Vidlio Movies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### `Tasks`
Implement a web application that allows a General User to browse available movies and have the option to like them. A user can be an admin user therefore, they have authorization to edit each movie. The data should be recieved from a mongo-DB database.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `Criteria`
  • Build a simple UI 
  • Focus on making each Component portable, scalable, and Abstracted
  • Focus on getting the correct user for admin priviledges
  • Focus on having a single source of truth within each component

### `Summary`
Although the backend is 90% complete there is a few config files that need to be adjusted before hosting it on heroku. However, the frontend is fully implemented and I decided to use the most modern tecnologies for this project. This includes React for the frontend for its fimarility with HTML and Javascript and Express.js for the backend because it is easy to use and one of my favorites. I decided to use more modern React features such as hooks and Context in my next project because I wanted to review a bit of React syntax before the common use of function components and useHooks.
